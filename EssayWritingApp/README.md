# AI-Based Essay Marking Application

## Overview

This is an AI-based essay marking application designed to provide instant results and feedback on your essay writing skills. The app simulates a testing environment similar to the PTE exam, where you are given a random essay topic, a 20-minute timer, and the opportunity to self-evaluate your essay performance.

The essay topics are automatically generated from a SharePoint list, ensuring a varied and dynamic experience. After completing the essay, you can immediately receive feedback on your writing and reattempt the same question if you wish.
